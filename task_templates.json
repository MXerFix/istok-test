As a boy, he was fascinated by ships and dreamed about sea adventures. He heard a lot of such stories from his first teacher and from various sailors from the port. There is a story, maybe a fictional one, that at the age 11 he intended to become a cabin-boy on a ship but was stopped by his parents.  His favourite childhood book is thought to have been Robinson Crusoe.  The motive of a lonely man on an isolated island later will appear in some of his books.  "

Jules had studied law both in Nantes and in Paris until he got his degree in 1851. But even before that he achieved his first literary success: his friend Alexandre Dumas-son produced Verne’s first play in his theatre in 1850. Having become a professional lawyer, Jules never seriously worked in this area. He was employed by a magazine as a writer and published articles on travel, history, and science. At the same time, he began writing short stories and later  novels"

The family of the girl Jules fell in love with, did not allow the young people to marry. This left him heartbroken and made him write poetry. So, as it can be seen, he tried himself in many literary genres but that did not make him financially stable. When he met his future wife, Honorine, in 1856, Jules had to start working in her father’s business to guarantee the family’s permission to marry his love."

This collaboration finally allowed Vernes to concentrate fully on his literary work."

For example, several people undertook to repeat the round-the-world trip described by Verne. Nancy Bly managed to make it in 72 days – in less than Verne’s characters."

He studied first in Krakow university and then went to Italy to continue and complete his education. Both in Poland and in Italy he studied mathematics and astronomy. In Italy he also got interested in medicine. All his life Copernicus was very religious. As a young man, he became a monk and never had a family of his own.   Copernicus thought that it was impossible to understand astronomy without using mathematics. At that time people believed that the Earth was the centre of the universe.  So the Sun, the Moon and all planets and stars were moving around our planet. This theory came from ancient Greece. Some people think that Copernicus knew about this second theory, which  was also  born in Greece. That second theory put the Sun in the centre. It was called heliocentric.  Using mathematics, Copernicus explained that the heliocentric theory was correct."
