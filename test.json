There is a story, maybe a fictional one, that at the age 11 he intended to become a cabin-boy on a ship but was stopped by his parents.  His favourite childhood book is thought to have been Robinson Crusoe.  The motive of a lonely man on an isolated island later will appear in some of his books.  "

Having become a professional lawyer, Jules never seriously worked in this area. He was employed by a magazine as a writer and published articles on travel, history, and science.

He studied first in Krakow university and then went to Italy to continue and complete his education. Both in Poland and in Italy he studied mathematics and astronomy. In Italy he also got interested in medicine. All his life Copernicus was very religious. As a young man, he became a monk and never had a family of his own.   Copernicus thought that it was impossible to understand astronomy without using mathematics. At that time people believed that the Earth was the centre of the universe.  So the Sun, the Moon and all planets and stars were moving around our planet. This theory came from ancient Greece. Some people think that Copernicus knew about this second theory, which  was also  born in Greece. That second theory put the Sun in the centre. It was called heliocentric.  Using mathematics, Copernicus explained that the heliocentric theory was correct."
