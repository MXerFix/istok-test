He was born in 1473 in the city of Torun in a rich family. His father was Polish, and his mother was German. He was the youngest of five children. He studied first in Krakow university and then went to Italy to continue and complete his education. Both in Poland and in Italy he studied mathematics and astronomy. In Italy he also got interested in medicine. All his life Copernicus was very religious. As a young man, he became a monk and never had a family of his own.   Copernicus thought that it was impossible to understand astronomy without using mathematics. At that time people believed that the Earth was the centre of the universe.  So the Sun, the Moon and all planets and stars were moving around our planet. This theory came from ancient Greece. Some people think that Copernicus knew about this second theory, which  was also  born in Greece. That second theory put the Sun in the centre. It was called heliocentric.  Using mathematics, Copernicus explained that the heliocentric theory was correct."

        "text": "Charles Dickens is one of the greatest English writers. He was born in 1812 in a middle-class family. His father was a well-paid office worker. However, he was not accurate with money and often invested it into risky projects. So, when Charles was only 12, his father got to prison for his debts. Mr Dickens wasn’t really worried about the family. Charles, however, had to leave school and to start working in a factory. It was a difficult time, but Charles learned a lot about the life of working-class people. When his father got out of prison, Charles planned to go back to school, but his mother wanted him to work and earn money. She knew that his father would soon get into a difficult situation and Charles would need to work again. Some researchers think that, because of this conflict with his mother, Dickens did not show a good understanding of women in his novels. He went back to school, but at the age of 15 had to leave it and to start working again – this time in an office. Dickens had a difficult youth, but it gave him a lot of material for his future books. He described his own experience in David Copperfield, one of his best-known novels."

The team that lost the game could be killed. So, it was a really dangerous sport. Ancient Greeks also played something like football. But they thought it was not a real sport, but a silly game. That’s why their ‘football’ was not part of the Olympic Games. Modern football was invented in England. Probably, already 900 years ago men played a ball game. The rules, however, were different. The ball could be not only kicked with a foot but also thrown with a hand. Also, for a long time there was no clear division between two games – rugby and football. The English could not agree on the rules for a long time. The teams could not agree even on the number of players. Teams did not have uniforms. So, it was difficult for fans to understand who was who. For a long time football remained a British game. Only in 1904 it became international when seven European countries organised the International Federation of Football (FIFA). Interestingly, British teams did not join it until 1950."

As they do not have chimneys, there are holes above each fire to send the smoke outside. (2). These houses are generally long and narrow, and contain each from one to five or six families. As soon as the snow begins to disappear in the spring, the winter camps break up, and the whole tribe disperses here and there into small parties or families. (3). Here, then, their fish barriers are constructed, by the united labour of the whole village or camp staying in one place. (4). The tribe then elects one or more men to oversee how the catch is divided between families.  (5). Their authority is law in such matters till the end of the fishing season, which is generally about the beginning of October. As soon as the fish season is over, the Indians move to woods or mountains, as they did in the spring, and divide into little groups for the purpose of hunting various animals. (6).

Furs were popular in Europe, and most of them were imported from North America and Russia. For example, gentlemen all across Europe wore hats made of beaver fur. (2). Due to all these qualities, he soon became very wealthy, and by his death in 1848 Astor was the richest man in the USA, having become the first American multimillionaire. At some stage of his career Astor realized that money could be easily made without leaving New York.  (3) There is a street and a subway station  in modern Manhattan having his name. In the subway station, one can still see the image of a beaver chewing a tree – a reminder of Astor’s fur trade. (4). They often would buy a big plot of land and rent it to a developer for 20 years. It made no sense for a developer to build something good there because he could only use it for two decades. (5). Part of this rent went to the Astors. Then the Astors  destroyed the slums and  re-invested the money in construction of  something much more expensive on the same land. Because of this scheme they were called ‘slumlords’. One of the 20th century Astors, realised that being a ‘slumlord’ was not a honourable thing. (6) She helped homeless people building houses for them, financed the creation of the Chinese garden in the Metropolitan Museum of Arts and established a medical centre for animals. But Brooke’s favourite place to support was the New York Public Library."

The correct answer seems to be: in most cases they did not. There is an interesting 17th century English book called 'The Book of Days' describing different aspects of people's everyday life. It appears that what families really washed were things like towels, bed sheets, pillow-cases, etc. (1). What did they sleep in? Probably, the poorest people did not have any special night clothes or even bed sheets, etc. (2). These night dresses were usually made of expensive materials. For example, one of the 16th century English queens slept in a black silk and velvet gown. Her daughter, the great monarch Elizabeth Tudor, had a nightgown made of black velvet and decorated with fur. Such materials as silk, velvet and fur could be destroyed by washing. (3). The best solution available to rich people was to wear such gowns only a couple of times and then replace them with new ones. That concerned not only nightgowns, but day clothes as well. For example, in 1603 before her death, Elizabeth Tudor had more than 2,000 dresses in her wardrobe. (4). Such gowns, as Elizabeth wore, consisted of many layers and, not being washed, were very attractive to different insects. So it was fashionable in the 16th century to wear traps for insects ('flea traps') on one's belt. (5). Ladies were proud of these accessories and demonstrated them openly. It seems that poor people did not have any underwear at all. What about the upper classes? Men's shirts were thought to be underwear, and it was not polite to demonstrate one's shirt in public. It was fine to show only the richly decorated collars. (6). For both sexes it was the only piece of clothing that was regularly washed."

In the records of Egyptian medical practice, the origins of chemistry, anatomy, physiology, and botany can be traced. The first physician of whom history has preserved the name, Imhotep, lived about 4500 BC. Recent studies have also brought to light pictures of surgical operations dating back to 2500 BC. (1) The patients in the picture are suffering pain. According to the inscription, one cries out, ‘Do this and let me go,’ and the other, ‘Don’t hurt me so!’ The most satisfactory data on Egyptian medicine are contained in the Ebers Papyrus. This document demonstrated knowledge of the pulse in different parts of the body, of a relation between the heart and the other organs, and of the passage of the breath to the lungs and heart. (2) Its main part is a collection of prescriptions for the eyes, ears, stomach, etc. Each prescription contains several ingredients. Among the seven hundred recognized remedies there are many familiar medicinal plants, as well as bicarbonate of soda and salts of lead and copper. (3) According to a Greek historian, there was a school of medicine in Babylon. Archaeologists found a letter written by a physician and addressed to a king in the 7th century BC. The author of the letter was giving advice on treatment of a nosebleed, which the king’s friend was suffering from. (4) Other letters from the same period mention the presence of physicians at court. We even have the name (Ilu-bani) of a physician who lived in southern Babylonia about 2700 BC. The most interesting information, however, in reference to Babylonian medicine dates from the time of Hammurabi (1793-1750 BC). It appears from the law code drawn up in the reign of that monarch that the Babylonian surgeons were able to operate a cataract. (5) In case the patient lost their life or sight as the result of an unsuccessful operation, the surgeon was condemned to have his hands amputated. The Babylonian records of medicine reveal the presence of many religious beliefs. The spirits of evil bring diseases upon us; the gods heal the diseases that attack people. (6) Also, they have descriptions of various rituals that doctors had to perform to help patients."

(1) It must also be said that the influence of civilizations earlier than Greek one on Western science has come to us to mostly through Greek literature. Nevertheless, if you look at the very origins of the sciences, you will inevitably be taken to the banks of the Nile, and to the valleys of the Tigris and the Euphrates. (2) Though they are much more remote in time from us than ancient Greece their wisdom and practical knowledge are easier to be comprehended by our minds than the difficult ideas of Greek philosophy. Much that we inherited from the earliest civilizations is so familiar, that we simply accept it without asking where it came from. (3) Why are there sixty minutes in the hour, and why are there not sixty hours in the day? These artificial divisions of time are accepted so universally that to ask a reason for them may seem almost absurd. (4) Even in that remote age (about 2500 years BC ) the Babylonians had established those divisions of time which are familiar to us. The seven days of the week were closely associated in men's thinking with the space bodies.  (5) Thus, we see that the making seven days a unit of time depends on the religious belief and astronomical science of a very remote civilization.  Another piece of common knowledge—the cardinal points of the compass (north, south, east and west) — may be  taken for granted. (6) Archeologists discovered that the sides of the temples and palaces of Assyria and Babylonia were directed to the four cardinal points of the compass. In Egypt the pyramids, erected before 3000 BC ., followed the cardinal direction so strictly that there is a hypothesis that one of the purposes was to establish, in this land of shifting sands, east and west and north and south.
